## VALBOT

**VALBOT** is a discord bot for Valorant stats.

Using the `.stats [player#ID]` command in your discord server, you'll be able to see that player's Valorant stats, such as:
* Rank Stats
  * Current Rank
  * K/D
  * Winrate %
* Last Matches (G:W/L)
* Last Game Played
* Recent Agents Winrate
* Average Combat Score
* Average K/D

In a specific channel, you can have members from your Discord Server get a custom role corresponding to their in-game rank.
Using the `.vrank [player#ID]` command, **VALBOT** will automaticaly give that user a role corresponding to their in-game rank.

_ex: in-game rank: Diamond 2 | discord role: Diamond._

The `.vstatus` command, gives you the current status of the Valorant European Servers.

The `.vupdate` command, gives you the latest Game Update News concerning Valorant.
